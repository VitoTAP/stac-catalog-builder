## Stacbuilder commands and options

There are two ways to run it:

- A) Run the python file: __main__.py
- B) Run it as a module

To run it as a module you may need to be in the root of the git folder, or set `PYTHONPATH` to include it.
This is not a fully polished Python package yet, that could be installed.

As usual, there is a `--help` option that shows you the usage, but without any argument the program will also display the usage.

### a) Run the __main__.py file

```bash
# show the usage
python3 stacbuilder/__main__.py --help
```

### a) Run it as a module

```bash
# show the usage
python3 -m stacbuilder --help
```

### Usage

```
$ python -m stacbuilder

```

The main command is off course `build`.
The other commands are meant for troubleshooting and show you what metadata or stac items the tool would generate (So these commands don't a STAC collection).

Another useful one is `test-openeo`, because for our purposes, the goal is that it works with load_stac in openEO.

```shell
$python3 -m  stacbuilder build --help
Usage: python -m stacbuilder build [OPTIONS] INPUTDIR OUTPUTDIR

  Build a STAC collection from a directory of geotiff files.

Options:
  -g, --glob TEXT               glob pattern for collecting the geotiff files.
                                Example: */*.tif
  -c, --collection-config FILE  Configuration file for the collection
  --overwrite                   Replace the entire output directory when it
                                already exists
  -m, --max-files INTEGER       Stop processing after this maximum number of
                                files.
  --help                        Show this message and exit.
```
