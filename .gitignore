# PyCharm
#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.

# VS code
.vscode/

#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:

# Having a .local folder that is ignored by git is often handy for files that you want
# to keep near your code but that are not part of the git repo because they won't work for everyone.
# For example your own configuration files for testing that will only work in your
# own development environment.
# Off course, you could also put them outside your git working dir, but sometimes
# having everything inside the workspace makes things simpler.

# Sometimes test output from generating STAC collections goes here
# Though we are avoiding that more and more now.
# The unit tests no longer use it.
