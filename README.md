# STAC Catalog Builder

This tool generates a STAC collection from a set of GeoTiff images.

It is mainly intended to create STAC collections and catalogs for use in [openEO](https://openeo.org/), with the load_stac process.

It requires a some configuration for the fields we need to fill in, but the goal is to make it much easier to generate STAC collections from a set of EO images.

For now it only supports GeoTIFFs. For example, netCDF is not supported yet, because it can be a lot more complex to extract info from than GeoTIFF.
We wanted to start with GeoTIFF and we can see about other needs later.

Support for uploading to a STAC API is in the making.
